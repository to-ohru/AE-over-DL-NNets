Artificial Evolution Algorithmic Driven Development of Deep Learning Modular Neural Network Designs

Modular neural networks have been shown to reduce a single large neural network to smaller, potentially more manageable blocks. The potential benefits of modular neural networks may improve: Efficiency of computation, Training load, Problem or task robustness. 

The development of novel Modular Neural Networks may be benefitted through the application of Artificial Evolutional algorithmic techniques. 

This study will explore the potential benefits and opportunities in the synergy of these areas.
